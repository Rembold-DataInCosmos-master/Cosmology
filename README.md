# Homework 6: Cosmology

Alongside your partner, your task is to write 2 short computational essays, answering the 2 questions on this assignment. Please export each essay as a **standalone** HTML file with names like: `Problem1.html`, `Problem2.html`, etc. The HTML needs to be standalone so that all images are embedded within it, as otherwise I could not see them if you only uploaded the HTML.

Data for each problem is contained in the `/data` folder, and should be in a format that you can easily import into your scripting language of choice. Note that units are included in several of the CSV's, but are in a row that has been "commented" out. There are options in both Python and R when reading in CSV content to ignore commented rows that you may find useful.
